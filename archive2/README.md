# Challenge Name

Even Fibonacci Numbers

# Challenge Description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with and , the first terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Special Note

The pdf solution in this directory is very lacking in consistency, understandable explanation and formal proofs.
Though the code works the pdf leaves much to be desired and I'll fix it sometime soon.
