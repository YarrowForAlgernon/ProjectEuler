# A walkthrough of ProjectEuler

This repository serves as a walk through of the first 100 ProjectEuler archives.

The focus of each archive will be less on the answer and more on the mathematical ideas behind them.
In-depth solutions can be found in the form of a PDF located in each archive folder.

## Archive format

Archives will be split into (where possible) two directories, 'naive\_solution', 'efficient\_solutions' and a pdf explanation, which delves into the mathematical thought behind each solution.

Solutions are coded in python and eventually C++
