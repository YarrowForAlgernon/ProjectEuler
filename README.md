# A walkthrough of ProjectEuler

This repository serves as a walk through of the first 100 ProjectEuler archives.

A pdf explanation of each archived problem can be found in each archives' directory. These walkthroughs focus less on the coded solutions and instead explain the maths behind them.

## Archive format

Archives will be split into seperate directories named after and containing their respective solutions. These directories will also contain a README with the archived problems description and title on the [ProjectEuler website](https://projecteuler.net/)

Solutions are coded in python first and eventually C++.
