# A walkthrough of ProjectEuler

This repository serves as a walk through of the first 100 ProjectEuler archives.

The focus of each archive will be less on the answer and more on the mathematical ideas behind them.
Non In-depth explanations of challenges can also be found on my medium account [here](https://medium.com/@AhmedCyber),
And in-depth ones in the form of a pdf located in each archive folder.

## Archive format

Archives will be split into (where possible) two directories, 'naive\_solution', 'efficient\_solution' and a pdf explanation, which delves into the mathematical thought behind each solution.

Solutions are coded in python and c++. This means there are at least 4 different coding solutions for each archive.
