## A walkthrough of ProjectEuler

This repository serves as a walk through of the first 100 ProjectEuler archives.

The focus of each archive will be less on the answer and more on the mathematical ideas behind them.

# Archive format

Archives will be split into a (where possible) naive solution, an efficient solution and an explanation.

Solutions are coded in python, c++ and Java. This means there are at least 6 different coding solutions for each archive.
